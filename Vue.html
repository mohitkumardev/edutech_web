            <h3>Vue.js </h3>
            <p>is an open-source model–view–viewmodel front end JavaScript framework for building user interfaces and
                single-page applications.[10] It was created by Evan You, and is maintained by him and the rest of the
                active core team members</p>
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>Vue.js features an incrementally adaptable architecture that focuses on declarative rendering and
                component composition. The core library is focused on the view layer only.[4] Advanced features required
                for complex applications such as routing, state management and build tooling are offered via officially
                maintained supporting libraries and packages.[12]

                Vue.js allows for extending HTML with HTML attributes called directives.[13] The directives offer
                functionality to HTML applications, and come as either built-in or user defined directives.</p>
            <h3>Features</h3>
            <p>Vue components extend basic HTML elements to encapsulate reusable code. At a high level, components are
                custom elements to which the Vue's compiler attaches behavior. In Vue, a component is essentially a Vue
                instance with pre-defined options.[35] The code snippet below contains an example of a Vue component.
                The component presents a button and prints the number of times the button is clicked:</p>
            <h3>Templates</h3>
            <p>Vue uses an HTML-based template syntax that allows binding the rendered DOM to the underlying Vue
                instance's data. All Vue templates are valid HTML that can be parsed by specification-compliant browsers
                and HTML parsers. Vue compiles the templates into virtual DOM render functions. A virtual Document
                Object Model (or "DOM") allows Vue to render components in its memory before updating the browser.
                Combined with the reactivity system, Vue can calculate the minimal number of components to re-render and
                apply the minimal amount of DOM manipulations when the app state changes.</p>
