            <h3>Web development?</h3>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>is the work involved in developing a website for the Internet (World Wide Web) or an intranet (a private
                network).[1] Web development can range from developing a simple single static page of plain text to
                complex web applications, electronic businesses, and social network services. A more comprehensive list
                of tasks to which Web development commonly refers, may include Web engineering, Web design, Web content
                development, client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, Web server and network security
                configuration, and e-commerce development.

                Among Web professionals, "Web development" usually refers to the main non-design aspects of building Web
                sites: writing markup and coding.[2] Web development may use content management systems (CMS) to make
                content changes easier and available with basic technical skills.</p>
            <h3>Web design</h3>
            <p>encompasses many different skills and disciplines in the production and maintenance of websites. The
                different areas of web design include web graphic design; user interface design (UI design); authoring,
                including standardised code and proprietary software; user experience design (UX design); and search
                engine optimization. Often many individuals will work in teams covering different aspects of the design
                process, although some designers will cover them all.[1] The term "web design" is normally used to
                describe the design process relating to the front-end (client side) design of a website including
                writing markup. Web design partially overlaps web engineering in the broader scope of web development.
                Web designers are expected to have an awareness of usability and be up to date with web accessibility
                guidelines.</p>
            <h3>Web development tools</h3>
            <p>allow web developers to test and debug their code. They are different from website builders and
                integrated development environments (IDEs) in that they do not assist in the direct creation of a
                webpage, rather they are tools used for testing the user interface of a website or web application.

                Web development tools come as browser add-ons or built-in features in web browsers. Most popular web
                browsers, such as Google Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari, Microsoft Edge and Opera,[1] have
                built-in tools to help web developers, and many additional add-ons can be found in their respective
                plugin download centers.</p>
            <h3>A web developer </h3>
            <p> is a programmer who develops World Wide Web applications using a clientâ€“server model. The applications
                typically use HTML, CSS and JavaScript in the client, PHP, ASP.NET (C#), Python, Node.js, Go or Java in
                the server, and http for communications between client and server. A web developer may specialize in
                client-side applications (front-end developer), server-side applications (back-end developer), or both
                (full-stack developer).
