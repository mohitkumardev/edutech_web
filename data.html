            <h3>What Is a Database?</h3>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h4>Database defined</h4>
            <p>A database is an organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored
                electronically in
                a computer system. A database is usually controlled by a database management system (DBMS).
                Together, the
                data and the DBMS, along with the applications that are associated with them, are referred to as a
                database
                system, often shortened to just database.

                Data within the most common types of databases in operation today is typically modeled in rows and
                columns
                in a series of tables to make processing and data querying efficient. The data can then be easily
                accessed,
                managed, modified, updated, controlled, and organized. Most databases use structured query language
                (SQL)
                for writing and querying data</p>
            <h3>What is Structured Query Language (SQL)?</h3>
            <p>SQL is a programming language used by nearly all relational databases to query, manipulate, and
                define data,
                and to provide access control. SQL was first developed at IBM in the 1970s with Oracle as a major
                contributor, which led to implementation of the SQL ANSI standard, SQL has spurred many extensions
                from
                companies such as IBM, Oracle, and Microsoft. Although SQL is still widely used today, new
                programming
                languages are beginning to appear</p>
            <h3>Evolution of the database</h3>
            <p>Databases have evolved dramatically since their inception in the early 1960s. Navigational databases
                such as
                the hierarchical database (which relied on a tree-like model and allowed only a one-to-many
                relationship),
                and the network database (a more flexible model that allowed multiple relationships), were the
                original
                systems used to store and manipulate data. Although simple, these early systems were inflexible. In
                the
                1980s, relational databases became popular, followed by object-oriented databases in the 1990s. More
                recently, NoSQL databases came about as a response to the growth of the internet and the need for
                faster
                speed and processing of unstructured data. Today, cloud databases and self-driving databases are
                breaking
                new ground when it comes to how data is collected, stored, managed, and utilized.</p>
            <h3>What’s the difference between a database and a spreadsheet?</h3>
            <p>Databases and spreadsheets (such as Microsoft Excel) are both convenient ways to store information.
                The
                primary differences between the two are:
                <br>
                1.How the data is stored and manipulated<br>
                2.Who can access the data<br>
                3.How much data can be stored<br>
                Spreadsheets were originally designed for one user, and their characteristics reflect that. They’re
                great
                for a single user or small number of users who don’t need to do a lot of incredibly complicated data
                manipulation. Databases, on the other hand, are designed to hold much larger collections of
                organized
                information—massive amounts, sometimes. Databases allow multiple users at the same time to quickly
                and
                securely access and query the data using highly complex logic and language
