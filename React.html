            <h3>Before We Start the Tutorial</h3>

            <p> We will build a small game during this tutorial. You might be tempted to skip it because you’re not
                building games — but give it a chance. The techniques you’ll learn in the tutorial are fundamental to
                building any React app, and mastering it will give you a deep understanding of React.</p>

            <h3>What Are We Building?</h3>
            <p>In this tutorial, we’ll show how to build an interactive tic-tac-toe game with React.

                You can see what we’ll be building here: Final Result. If the code doesn’t make sense to you, or if you
                are unfamiliar with the code’s syntax, don’t worry! The goal of this tutorial is to help you understand
                React and its syntax.

                We recommend that you check out the tic-tac-toe game before continuing with the tutorial. One of the
                features that you’ll notice is that there is a numbered list to the right of the game’s board. This list
                gives you a history of all of the moves that have occurred in the game, and it is updated as the game
                progresses.

                You can close the tic-tac-toe game once you’re familiar with it. We’ll be starting from a simpler
                template in this tutorial. Our next step is to set you up so that you can start building the game.

            <h3>Prerequisites</h3>
            <p>We’ll assume that you have some familiarity with HTML and JavaScript, but you should be able to follow
                along even if you’re coming from a different programming language. We’ll also assume that you’re
                familiar with programming concepts like functions, objects, arrays, and to a lesser extent, classes.

                If you need to review JavaScript, we recommend reading this guide. Note that we’re also using some
                features from ES6 — a recent version of JavaScript. In this tutorial, we’re using arrow functions,
                classes, let, and const statements. You can use the Babel REPL to check what ES6 code compiles to</p>

            <h3>Setup for the Tutorial</h3>
            <p>There are two ways to complete this tutorial: you can either write the code in your browser, or you can
                set up a local development environment on your computer.</p>

            <h3>Setup Option 1: Write Code in the Browser</h3>
            <p>This is the quickest way to get started!

                First, open this Starter Code in a new tab. The new tab should display an empty tic-tac-toe game board
                and React code. We will be editing the React code in this tutorial.

                You can now skip the second setup option, and go to the Overview section to get an overview of React.
            </p>
            <h3>Setup Option 2: Local Development Environment</h3>
            <p>This setup requires more work but allows you to complete the tutorial using an editor of your choice.
                Here are the steps to follow:

               <br> 1. Make sure you have a recent version of Node.js installed.<br>
                2. Follow the installation instructions for Create React App to make a new project.</p>
