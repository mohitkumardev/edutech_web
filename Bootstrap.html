            <h3>Bootstrap</h3>
            <p>is a free and open-source CSS framework directed at responsive, mobile-first front-end web development.
                It contains HTML, CSS and (optionally) JavaScript-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons,
                navigation, and other interface components</p>
            <h3>Features</h3>
            <p>Bootstrap is an HTML, CSS & JS Library that focuses on simplifying the development of informative web
                pages (as opposed to web apps). The primary purpose of adding it to a web project is to apply
                Bootstrap's choices of color, size, font and layout to that project. As such, the primary factor is
                whether the developers in charge find those choices to their liking. Once added to a project, Bootstrap
                provides basic style definitions for all HTML elements. The result is a uniform appearance for prose,
                tables and form elements across web browsers. In addition, developers can take advantage of CSS classes
                defined in Bootstrap to further customize the appearance of their contents. For example, Bootstrap has
                provisioned for light- and dark-colored tables, page headings, more prominent pull quotes, and text with
                a highlight.</p>
            <h3>Questionable HTML in example</h3>
            <p>I haven't used Bootstrap yet, but while reading this article I was struck by the 'Creating a fixed layout
                grid with fluid layout grid nested' example using
                a bunch of times. Is this mandated by Bootstrap or is it just something unique to the
                example? It's probably not ideal to use this as a basic example because using a digit as the first
                character in a CSS identifier is invalid unless it's escaped. --Ryan Williams (talk) 14:27, 14 September

            <h3>User scripts</h3>
            <p>The WikiProject is also taking on the organization of the Wikipedia community's user script support
                pages. If you are interested in helping to organize information on the user scripts (or are curious
                about what we are up to), let us know!

                If you have need for a user script that does not yet exist, or you have a cool idea for a user script or
                gadget, you can post it at Wikipedia:User scripts/Requests. And if you are a JavaScript programmer,
                that's a great place to find tasks if you are bored</p>
